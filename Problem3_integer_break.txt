Problem 6 Integer Break:
1.	To solve this problem, we must find the products of the different ways a given integer, x, can be broken down. This means that we need to calculate the products of smaller numbers that when added result in x. This can be done by iterating through the possible instances of integers that add up to the target (e.g. 3: 1 + 1 + 1 & 2 + 1) and calculating their products to select the largest one (e.g. 3: 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 & 2 * 1 = 2 => solution is 2).
2.	By storing the product of all numbers leading to x in an array we can avoid the repetitive calculations of cases like 6: 3 + 2, where we could have already calculated the maximum product of the numbers that are subproblems to the larger one.
3.	I identified the problem by looking at the examples and re-reading the problem, making sure I understood what it was stating and that my understanding of it supported the examples. I defined the inputs and outputs that the problem expects and how those are achieved. I explored different approaches to the problem, like trying to split the integer in half to see if that was usually the best solution or not. I acted by trying to solve one of the examples myself and recognizing patterns. In the end I looked back at how the problem could have tricked me if I had not read carefully and understood the examples.
