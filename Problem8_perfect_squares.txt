Problem 8 Perfect Squares:
1.	The problem asks us to find all the sums of squares that are equal to a target and to return the sum with the least number of squares in it. This means that with a target x, we need to find the least amount of square numbers that equal to x. To do this, we can repeatedly find the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to x (e. g. 1 * 1 + 1 * 1…, 2 * 2 + 2 * 2…,). However, this repetition can be avoided by storing the minimum sum of squares for all previous numbers temporarily so that these calculations do not have to be done more than once.
2.	I believe that the best idea is to store the solutions to the subproblems in an array (e.g. after calculating the solution to 6: 3 goes in position 6) and have them at the ready whenever future calculations require their values (e.g. 15: 3 * 3 + 6 or 3 * 3 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 which we already knew).
3.	I used IDEAL to solve this problem by identifying what the problem was asking for and trying to solve instances of the problem before trying to arrive to a conclusion. I also looked back at what I had done in solving those subproblems and how I had arrived at my result, as well as how it all related to the big picture.
